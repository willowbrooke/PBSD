Pat Brown School of Dancing README
-------------------------------------

Hello, this project was created by Willow Martindale and Kayla Williams. We chose this website because I, Kayla Williams, have been dancing at Pat Brown School of Dancing for 14 years. We requested to work with each other because we both have strong work ethics and both bring something different to the table.

We chose to create a website for Pat Brown School of Dancing because we believe that this dance studio should have a better website than it had previously. We wanted our website to be simple to access and more efficient for those interested.


Whole Website:

-The dance studio, Pat Brown School of Dancing, originally had a website that didn't offer enough accessibility and wasn't as appealing to the eye as we wanted it to be. So, one of us contacted the business and asked if we could create this website.

-We basically kept logo the same. It is the silhouette of a dancer that once danced at Pat Brown School of Dancing.

-In the beginning we wanted to make sure that we made our website more legible and person friendly.  

-For our footer we had to overcome several obstacles. Approximately, we changed it about 6 times before we finally were satisfied.
We chose to include links for the address, phone number, hours, and email. For social media we included a Facebook link.


About:

-On our about page we described when Pat Brown School of Dancing was founded. We explained our businesses mission and what they hope to accomplish. We also included questions that are frequently asked. 
-We included three pictures on this page to give the viewer a glimpse of what goes on in the studio.

Teachers:

-For the teachers page we introduced each teacher and proved a basic description of them as a person and the experience they have.
-For each teacher we included a headshot of them.

Classes:

-Here on our classes page we listed each class offered at the dancing school. There was a lot of information so we tried to condense it and make it more comprehensive.
-On this page we chose to add three pictures of different classes taken at Pat Brown. 

Registration:

-The registration page is just a basic explanation of how you can register and what prices they offer.

Contact:

-On the contact we listed their businesses address, phone number, hours, and email. We provided links and hovers to each of these elements.
-For more accessibility we chose to include a map.

Pictures:

-For the picture page we decided to upload pictures from Pat Brown School of Dancingâ€™s Facebook page.
